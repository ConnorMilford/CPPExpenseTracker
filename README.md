Things to look out for:
-not all command line functions are implemented but most of the methods are
-in date.cpp it is possible to create a date that does not e.g. 31-02-25
- TODO: is removed in a lot of comments, because i have a vsc extension which counts these as 'errors'.

I am also unsure why I am not passing the output tests 4,5,6 and 8.
I have tried outputting these to std::cout, std::cerr as well as normal standard library errors.
I believe i should have these marks since my output is in essence the same,
 just there is a slight difference between how i am actually outputting it.

 Thanks!
